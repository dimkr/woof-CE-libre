Introduction
============

This is a libre, GNU FSDG compliant fork of woof-CE
(https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE), which follows upstream closely.
It is used to build Librepup (http://librepup.info/), a libre fork of Puppy
Linux (http://www.puppylinux.org/).

woof-CE-libre is proudly hosted at https://notabug.org/dimkr/woof-CE-libre.

Currently, Librepup is based built using binary packages from
Trisquel (http://www.trisquel.info/) 7 and equivalent to Tahrpup 6.0.2.

Features
========

Unlike its upstream, woof-CE-libre:
  - Is deblobbed: (hopefully) all recommendations of non-free software in
    graphical wizards, scripts, etc' are removed.
  - Is pre-configured to produce the latest release of Librepup.

Relationship with Upstream
==========================

The "libre" branch of woof-CE-libre follows the "testing" branch of upstream.

Most features added by woof-CE-libre have been upstreamed, to ease maintenance:
  - Configuration and data files required to reproduce the latest upstream
    version of Puppy Linux (http://www.puppylinux.org/)
  - Support for Trisquel (http://www.trisquel.info/) packages and repositories
  - Support for "longterm" kernels that are forward- and backward- compatible
    with third-party drivers
  - Support for deblobbed kernels, using the Linux-libre
    (http://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/) scripts
  - Minor fixes and efficiency improvements

Librepup-specific additions (such as its configuration files) will not be
upstreamed, to reduce the risk of misleading users who associate the 'Librepup'
moniker with free software into using non-free software, if this branding is
used by a derivative of upstream.

Bugs
====

woof-CE-libre- or Librepup- specific issues (e.g non-free components in
Librepup) should be reported through
https://notabug.org/dimkr/woof-CE-libre/issues.

Other issues should be reported to upstream.
