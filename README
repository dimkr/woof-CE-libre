Introduction
============

This is a libre, GNU FSDG compliant fork of woof-CE
(https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/woof-CE), which follows upstream closely.
It is used to build Librepup (http://librepup.info/), a libre fork of Puppy
Linux (http://www.puppylinux.org/).

woof-CE-libre is proudly hosted at https://notabug.org/dimkr/woof-CE-libre.

Currently, Librepup is based built using binary packages from
Trisquel (http://www.trisquel.info/) 7 and equivalent to Tahrpup 6.0.2.

Features
========

Unlike its upstream, woof-CE-libre:
  - Is deblobbed: (hopefully) all recommendations of non-free software in
    graphical wizards, scripts, etc' are removed.
  - Is pre-configured to produce the latest release of Librepup.

Also, Librepup differs from the upsteam release it is based on:
  - It uses different artwork and branding, to avoid confusion between the two
  - Quickpet is removed, as it recommends non-free software
  - The non-free browser is replaced with QupZilla (http://www.qupzilla.com/)
  - The default IRC client is replaced with a patched HexChat
    (https://hexchat.github.io/) which does not recommend a non-free browser
  - Sylpheed (http://sylpheed.sraoss.jp/en/) has been updated and re-packaged,
    to remove files under /root
  - rxvt-unicode (http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) has been
    updated and re-packaged to drop all plugins, add a missing symlink and
    replace urxvt with the more efficient combination of urxvtc and urxvtd
  - DeaDBeeF (http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/) has been re-packaged, to move it
    to /usr and reduce its size
  - net_setup has been deblobbed
  - Clipit (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkclipit/) has been replaced with
    Parcellite (http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/), because it is newer and
    does not show popup windows
  - Osmo (http://clayo.org/osmo/) has been updated and built without exotic
    dependencies
  - The kernel has been updated to a newer minor version, deblobbed and rebuilt
    with a slightly modified configuration, for much better performance and
    responsiveness and with additional drivers
  - The default package repository has been replaced by Librepup's repository

Relationship with Upstream
==========================

The "libre" branch of woof-CE-libre follows the "testing" branch of upstream.

All features added by woof-CE-libre have been upstreamed, to ease maintenance:
  - Configuration and data files required to reproduce the latest upstream
    version of Puppy Linux (http://www.puppylinux.org/)
  - Support for Trisquel (http://www.trisquel.info/) packages and repositories
  - Support for "longterm" kernels that are forward- and backward- compatible
    with third-party drivers
  - Support for deblobbed kernels, using the Linux-libre
    (http://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/) scripts
  - Minor fixes and efficiency improvements
  - New and improved package templates

Librepup-specific additions (such as its configuration files) will not be
upstreamed, to reduce the risk of misleading users who associate the 'Librepup'
moniker with free software into using non-free software, if this branding is
used by a derivative of upstream.

Building Librepup
=================

Through Librepup or Puppy Linux (http://www.puppylinux.org/), run:
  ./merge2out
  cd ../woof-out_x86_x86_trisquel_belenos
  yes "" | ./0setup
  ./1download
  echo | ./2createpackages
  ./3builddistro-Z

It is possible to run woof-CE-libre through other distributions as well, using
run_woof (https://github.com/puppylinux-woof-CE/run_woof).

Bugs
====

woof-CE-libre- or Librepup- specific issues (e.g non-free components in
Librepup) should be reported through
https://notabug.org/dimkr/woof-CE-libre/issues.

Other issues should be reported to upstream.
